# Nephrotic survival SRR
Code used in Kolb et al. (2020): A national registry study of patient and renal survival in adult nephrotic syndrome.  


## About
This repository contains the code that was used to analyse the data presented in our paper, *A national registry study of patient and renal survival in adult nephrotic syndrome* (Kolb et al., KI Reports, 2020).  Here we reproduce the code that we used for our survival analyses and competing risk models and for estimating mortality in age- and sex-matched population.  


## Primary data
We are unable to share our primary data as this could breach patient confidentiality.  Requests for the primary data should be directed to the [Scottish Renal Registry](https://www.srr.scot.nhs.uk/). 


## Contributors
This code was written by Robert W Hunter and Peter Gallacher (University of Edinburgh).
